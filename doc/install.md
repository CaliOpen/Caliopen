  (Cassandra and Elasticsearch)
- gen-swagger-spec.sh: (native) re-generate swagger file and store it into
  [`src/backend/configs/`](../../src/backend/configs/) directory and html doc
  into [`src/backend/doc/api/`](../../src/backend/doc/api/)
- make_release: python script to build a release
- manage_package: python script to manage caliopen packages
- run-tests.sh: start tests in travis, this launch frontend or backend tests
  according to recent changes
- setup-virtualenv.sh: script to setup a python virtualenv for python developers
